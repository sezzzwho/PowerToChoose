# PowerToChoose
This project uses the [Power To Choose](https://www.powertochoose.org) website api in tandem with a list of Texas Zip Codes to provide a list of energy
administrators for any zip code entered by a homeowner in the state of Texas.  This will establish a comparison baseline for the best energy plans in the current timeframe.
